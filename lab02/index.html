		This is one of my favorite recipes to make. It is very easy, and very modular. You can add or remove ingredients by taste or availability. It is greasy, but not too greasy and not very heavy. It is a great recipe to have after waking up a bit groggy after a late night out. For other stir fry recipes, click <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/gallery/best-stir-fry-recipes/">here</a>.
